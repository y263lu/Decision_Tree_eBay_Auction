# Decision Tree: eBay Auction

Use decision tree to predict whether or not an auction will be predictive.

A competitive auction is defined as an auction with at least two bids placed on the item auctioned. 
The data include variables that describe the item (auction category), the seller (their eBay rating), and the auction terms that the seller selected (auction duration, opening price, currency, day-of-week of auction close). In addition, we have the price at which the auction closed.
